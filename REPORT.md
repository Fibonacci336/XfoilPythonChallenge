**Higher Reynolds number leads to lower viscosity**

C<sub>L</sub> vs AoA: Graph becomes more linear (less exponential) with higher Reynolds numbers.\
Increased turbulence leads to increases in lift overall. 

C<sub>D</sub> vs Aoa: Graph stays same shape but upper bound decreases from ~0.08 to ~0.04, specifically after changing the Reynolds number from 10 million to 15 million.\
Since the Reynolds number is increasing drastically, this means the viscosity is substantially lower at each increase leading to lower friction and therfore a lower drag.

C<sub>M</sub> vs Aoa: Similar to the C<sub>L</sub> vs AoA graph, while the graph keeps its curved shape, the slopes of different sides approaches a constant.\
Since <img src="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/97d656c1f8d012c6ef5a3073bc87be2e80a6e500">, where M, S, and c remain constant, slight increases in the dynamic pressure (q) caused by an increased Reynolds number leads to a slightly smaller C<sub>M</sub>.


C<sub>L</sub>/C<sub>D</sub> vs AoA: This graph becomes more jagged with high Reynolds numbers while keeping a similar shape.

Pressure Distribution: Comparing different angles of attack with different Reynolds numbers shows the graphs having essentially no differences highlighting that the Reynolds number has little to no effect on the pressure distribution.

Boundary Properties: The graphs become more eratic with higher Reynolds numbers. All graphs have their largest x-values at a Reynolds number of 10 million.
