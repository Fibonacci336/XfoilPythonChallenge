C<sub>L</sub> vs AoA: Graph becomes more linear (less exponential) with higher Reynolds numbers.

C<sub>D</sub> vs Aoa: Graph stays same shape but upper bound decreases from ~0.08 to ~0.04, specifically after changing the Reynolds number from 10 million to 15 million.

C<sub>M</sub> vs Aoa: Similar to the C<sub>L</sub> vs AoA graph, while the graph keeps its curved shape, the slopes of different sides approaches a constant.

C<sub>L</sub>/C<sub>D</sub> vs AoA: This graph becomes more jagged with high Reynolds numbers while keeping a similar shape.

Pressure Distribution: Comparing different angles of attack with different Reynolds numbers shows the graphs having essentially no differences highlighting that the Reynolds number has little to no effect on the pressure distribution.
