# XfoilPythonChallenge

**Programming Challenge for Siemens application** 
Using XFoil Python interface to perform calculations on NACA63(3)-618 airfoil and plot the results

__xfoil_module.py is originally from the [AeroPy repository](https://github.com/leal26/AeroPy)__\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This file was improved due to many bugs along with no support for Linux/macOS \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the future I will be improving more and submitting a PR to bring these benefits to the AeroPy repository

The [REPORT.md](./REPORT.md) file inside this repository is the requested report, using the generated plots and evaluating the results
